description: A timeseries data science project to forecast private employment in the US. Click <a href="https://github.com/chiyounglee01/forecasting_employment" target="blank">here</a> for the project's Github repository. <br></br><h1><b>Overview</b></h1><br></br><p>This project used timeseries models in R to forecast private employment numbers for Oct 2023 to Jan 2024. After I learned some of my former co-workers in the entertainment industry were laid off in September 2023, I wondered what job growth would be like during the next 4 months. I decided to use ADP’s private employment dataset to forecast job growth. The dataset can be found <a href="https://adpemploymentreport.com/" target="blank">here</a>.</p><p>The tools used include <b>dplyr</b> (for data manipulating), <b>modeltime</b> (ecosystem for time series forecasting), <b>lubridate</b> (for working with time data), and <b>ggplot2</b> (for visualization). The time series models compared were <b>Arima</b>, <b>Exponential Smoothing</b>, <b>Linear Regression</b>, <b>Prophet</b>, and <b>XGBoost</b>.</p><br></br><p><b>With this project I wanted to get familiar with Time Series based forecasting techniques and answer the following question:</b></p><p>*What will job growth look like in the private sector from 10/2023 to 01/2024?</p><br></br><h1>Choosing the Right Timeseries Model - General Summary</h1><br></br><p>As Private Employment numbers were in the millions I scaled the data. Although there was timeseries data from Jan 2010 to Sept 2023, there was an abnormal dip from April 2020 to Early 2022. So, when I split the data into train and test, instead of setting aside the usual 20% of data, I used 6 months of data, from April 2023 to Sept 2023.</p><br></br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiyounglee01/images/main/private_employment_dip.png"><p>The time series models compared were <b>Arima</b>, <b>Exponential Smoothing</b>, <b>Linear Regression</b>, <b>Prophet</b>, and <b>XGBoost</b></p>.<p><b>Linear Regression</b> and <b>Arima</b> were the two models with the lowest <b>MAE</b> (Mean Absolute Error) and <b>RMSE</b> (Root Mean Square Error)</p><br></br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiyounglee01/images/main/tibble.png"><p></p><p><b>Arima</b> was chosen as the final model as the forecast from <b>Arima</b> (red line)had a steady increase across the four months, while <b>Linear Regression</b> (green line) had ups and downs. <b>Arima</b> (red line) followed real life employment trends more than <b>Linear Regression</b></p><br></br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiyounglee01/images/main/arima_lm.png"><br></br><h1><b>MAIN FINDINGS</b></h1><p>With this project we learnt the following insights:</p><br></br><p><b>1. Although employment outlook on my LinkedIn feed looked dim in Sept 2023, the model forecasts there would be job growth in the private sector between Oct 2023 - Jan 2023. It is likely my LinkedIn feed is biased negatively.</b></p><br></br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiyounglee01/images/main/arima_forecast.png"><br></br><p><b>2. However, the model forecasts the average monthly percent change of job growth from Oct 2023 - Jan 2024 (0.13%) will be lower than the period from Jan 2023 - Sept 2023 (0.18%)</b></p><br></br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiyounglee01/images/main/monthly_pct_change_plot.png">
