description: "Hi, my name is Chiyoung Lee and I’m a Data Scientist based in Los Angeles, CA.

I currently work at DEPT® - an ad tech company with clients like Meta, ebay. I'm passionate about using technology to help brands connect with new customers and help them grow! Before becoming Data Scientist, I worked in animation production at Adult Swim. Even in Animation, I used data to grow audiences through social media. The thing I find the most exciting about Data Science is problem-solving and a chance to constantly learn new tools and technologies! I am proficient in Python, R, and SQL. I'm experienced in machine learning, data visualisation, NLP and data wrangling."
